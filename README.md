Benchmark models in order of increasing complexity
1. Flat clamped-clamped beam model, truncated to single linear mode (= Duffing oscillator)
2. Flat clamped-clamped beam model, truncated to Nm>1 modes
3. Curved clamped-clamped beam model, truncated to Nm>1 modes
4. Clamped-free beam with elastic dry friction element
5. Clamped-free beam with unilateral spring element
